# Abacus & Pascaline: Python Calculator Project

## 📜 Historical Context
The calculator is a symbol of technological evolution in mathematics. 
* **The Abacus (3000 BC):** Used by Babylonians and Egyptians, it used sliding beads for simple arithmetic.
* **The Pascaline (1642):** Invented by Blaise Pascal, it was the first mechanical calculator using geared wheels for addition and subtraction.
* **Leibniz's Improvement (1673):** Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz advanced this technology by enabling multiplication and division.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based mechanical calculator simulation. It evaluates mathematical expressions without using the forbidden `eval()` function or the `math` module.

### Features
- **Expression Evaluation:** Handles basic operations (+, -, *, /).
- **Operation Priority:** Correctly follows PEMDAS (Multiplication/Division before Addition/Subtraction).
- **History Management:** Record, view, and clear previous calculations.
- **Error Handling:** Explicit messages for division by zero or invalid inputs.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
